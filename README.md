# Dancer in the Dark

A (currently) 2-player game where you (currently) take turns seeking out a treasure. Along the way, you make note of traps and walls.

Once the treasure is secured, the exit is shown and you need to escape before the other players shoot you with arrows and claim the treasure as their own.

(Later) this will be a sneaking game where a thief must infiltrate a castle and pilfer the riches.

The thief is faster and more observant than the guards, but greatly outnumbered.
