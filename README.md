# Dancer in the Dark

## Current Premise
Currently, this is a 2-player game that places you in a dungeon against another enterprising treasure-hunter. The two of you must race through the dungeon in search of the treasure, making notes of traps and walls along your way.

Once the treasure is secured, the exit magically appears and the race for escape begins.

Beware the other players and their arrows!

### Movement
You are given a set number of moves per turn. You have 10 seconds to use them all before your turn ends and the other player's turn begins.

## Ultimate Goal
The end goal for this game is to have one player take the role of the thief as they infiltrate a castle teeming with guards. The thief has intuition on their side, and is able to see the intended moves to the guards beforehand, and plan out their moves accordingly.

They will do their best to move further into the castle and make use of hidden passageways for quick traversal, and shadows for sneaking past the guards. If required, the thief can employ deadly solutions to make sure they are not discovered.

Guards will place their moves and move as a group, staying on alert for anything out of place. If deemed necessary, a guard may sound the alarm to put the castle on lockdown after some time, but the king doesn't permit wanton usage of the whistles and will punish anyone abusing them.
